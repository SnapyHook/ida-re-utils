# Overview

This repository focuses on small, practical utilities that simplify
reverse engineering workflows inside IDA Pro.

The scripts demonstrate:
- IDA Python API usage
- Binary memory scanning
- Function metadata retrieval
- ARM64-oriented analysis

These tools are intentionally minimal and transparent to make them easy
to audit, extend, and reuse in research environments.
